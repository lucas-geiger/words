description: Distribute blog post to external platforms (Medium, Substack, LinkedIn)
---

Help me distribute a blog post to external platforms.

First, show me a list of recent posts with their distribution status (check the `distributed` field in frontmatter).

Ask which post to distribute and to which platform(s).

Then run the appropriate distribution command using `bun run scripts/distribute.ts` and update the frontmatter to track successful distribution.

Remind me to verify:

- All links are absolute URLs
- Images are accessible
- API credentials are configured
