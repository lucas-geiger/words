description: List all WIP content (drafts and research)
---

Show me an overview of all work-in-progress content.

List:

1. **Drafts** (`wip/content/`):
   - Show directory name and number
   - Extract title from draft.md if it exists
   - Show file size or word count if possible

2. **Research Notes** (`wip/research/`):
   - List all markdown files
   - Show first heading or first line as preview

3. **Published Posts** (`content/posts/`):
   - Count total published posts
   - Show most recent 3 posts with dates

This gives me a quick overview of:

- What drafts I'm working on
- What research I have available
- What's already published

Help me prioritize what to work on next.
