description: Create a new research note in wip/research/
---

Create a new research note in the knowledge base.

Ask me for:

- Topic name (will be kebab-cased for filename)

Then create a simple markdown file in `wip/research/topic-name.md`.

Research notes:

- Are NOT published to the blog
- Build your knowledge base over time
- Can be referenced when writing articles
- Have no required format - write freely

Think of these as your personal notes, explorations, and findings that inform your published articles but don't need to be public.
