Welcome to **Words** — a minimalist blog platform designed for writers who value process over perfection.

## Philosophy

This platform embraces a simple truth: great writing starts messy. That's why it includes:

- **Research notes** - A private knowledge base for explorations and findings
- **Draft directories** - Numbered workspaces where articles evolve naturally
- **Published posts** - Polished pieces ready for the world

## Built With Modern Tools

Words is powered by:

- **Astro v5** - Fast, content-focused static site generation
- **Bun** - Lightning-fast JavaScript runtime and package manager
- **TypeScript** - Type-safe tooling and content validation
- **GitHub Pages** - Simple, automated deployment

## Writing Workflow

The workflow is deliberately simple:

1. **Research** - Capture ideas and findings in `wip/research/`
2. **Draft** - Write freely in `wip/content/X-article-name/`
3. **Publish** - Promote finished drafts to `content/posts/`

No pressure. No rigid structure. Just write.

## What's Next

This is a demo post to showcase the platform. Future posts might cover:

- Deep dives into technical topics
- Writing and creativity
- Tools and workflows
- Personal projects and experiments

Thanks for stopping by. More words coming soon.
